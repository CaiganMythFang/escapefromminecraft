With the breaking of Bread, the VanilModu welcomes you to the trade network. \n\n    For now, you will only have us and a few other Trader groups to work with. Our stocks to you will be limited by your reputation with each of us. Likewise, what we are willing to purchase from you is likewise dependant upon your reputation.\n\n    If you are in need of cash and resources, and you have a surplus of salvaged items, you can utilize the Flea Market.\n\n    You can sell nearly any item in the Market. Whether it is worth anything is another matter, as the value of anything varies wildly. Usually, each item you sell with earn you a couple pennies at least, sometimes even more. \n\n    Occasionally, someone will trade you some resources for your item. Or they will trade you an unsearched piece of loot.\n\n    And sometimes, you\u0027ll get nothing back. That is the risk of playing the Flea Market.\n\n    Normally, the machine to access The Flea Market takes a bit of an investment. But for certain new Mercenaries, we offer a one time deal : Provide us 12 pieces of Unsearched Gear, and we\u0027ll give you enough to construct your own Flea Market kiosk.\n\n    If you lose this kiosk, or wish to build more of them, it will cost you the usual price.\n-------------------§r\n\n    §oHm, with the variety of items I\u0027m finding on these monsters, it might be a good idea to use this Flea Market, if only to get rid of excess junk and HOPEFULLY get something more useful."

It\u0027s difficult to track down a working Guide Laboratory, let alone someone who knows how to repair one.

Oh no, are you two from one of the deep underground cave communities? Do you have a Core Drill or something?!§o§r\n\n    §o...What?§r\n\n§3    Or maybe one of those damned nuclear Vaults they tricked people into? §r\n\n    §o...WHAT?§r\n\n    §3You\u0027d be far from the first in either case. But that\u0027s getting on a tangent. You want access to the Trade Network proper? You\u0027ll need Rank 2 with us VanilModu Traders first. Not too difficult, but it might take a bit of luck. It\u0027s quite simple, really : \n\n    We want to test your survivability. Send us all the items on the list. How you get them doesn\u0027t matter. Heck, you can purchase them from us and send em right back. Fill out the list, and I\u0027ll give you a special machine we\u0027ve recently developed : The Cleansing Sieve, which breaks down Corrupted Ore and Compressed Ruins and finds useable material for you."
