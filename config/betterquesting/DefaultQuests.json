With the breaking of Bread, the VanilModu welcomes you to the trade network. \n\n    For now, you will only have us and a few other Trader groups to work with. Our stocks to you will be limited by your reputation with each of us. Likewise, what we are willing to purchase from you is likewise dependant upon your reputation.\n\n    If you are in need of cash and resources, and you have a surplus of salvaged items, you can utilize the Flea Market.\n\n    You can sell nearly any item in the Market. Whether it is worth anything is another matter, as the value of anything varies wildly. Usually, each item you sell with earn you a couple pennies at least, sometimes even more. \n\n    Occasionally, someone will trade you some resources for your item. Or they will trade you an unsearched piece of loot.\n\n    And sometimes, you\u0027ll get nothing back. That is the risk of playing the Flea Market.\n\n    Normally, the machine to access The Flea Market takes a bit of an investment. But for certain new Mercenaries, we offer a one time deal : Provide us 12 pieces of Unsearched Gear, and we\u0027ll give you enough to construct your own Flea Market kiosk.\n\n    If you lose this kiosk, or wish to build more of them, it will cost you the usual price.\n-------------------§r\n\n    §oHm, with the variety of items I\u0027m finding on these monsters, it might be a good idea to use this Flea Market, if only to get rid of excess junk and HOPEFULLY get something more useful."

It\u0027s difficult to track down a working Guide Laboratory, let alone someone who knows how to repair one.

Oh no, are you two from one of the deep underground cave communities?

But that\u0027s getting on a tangent. You want access to the Trade Network proper? You\u0027ll need Rank 2 with us VanilModu Traders first. Not too difficult, but it might take a bit of luck. It\u0027s quite simple, really : \n\n    We want to test your survivability. Send us all the items on the list. How you get them doesn\u0027t matter. Heck, you can purchase them from us and send em right back. Fill out the list, and I\u0027ll give you a special machine we\u0027ve recently developed : The Cleansing Sieve, which breaks down Corrupted Ore and Compressed Ruins and finds useable material for you."

A better world. \n\n    Through Chemistry, we break it down.\n\n    Through Engineering, we build it up.\n\n    But what we lack is Materials. Money. Chemicals.

Provide these to us, and we\u0027ll provide you with SCIENCE!\n-------------------§r\n\n    §oKnowing there are both humans and anthros in this world is comforting in a way. The last dimensional mishap we had, the only sentient creature were slugs... slugs everywhere. That was... interesting.\n\n    Tangents aside, the Labrats look like they\u0027ll give me access to the first thing I\u0027ll need if I want to fix this mess I\u0027ve gotten myself into : chemistry equipment."

The world is dangerous, and many do not last long, no no.\n\n    No doubt you\u0027ve already had to deal with our small, unintelligent ancestors, yes? No? Perhaps your larders are a bit lessened of food? Holes in the wall? We can help you deal with them, but that is not our purpose in life. Our grand purpose!\n\n    We wish to understand the universe. What makes every single thing, down to the basic elements. Then... we can rebuild it, yes yes. A better world. \n\n    Through Chemistry, we break it down.\n\n    Through Engineering, we build it up.\n\n    But what we lack is Materials. Money. Chemicals. Test subjects. \n\n    Can you help provide these, maybe yes? At least some money, and some of the basic materials we need. Provide these to us, and we\u0027ll provide you with SCIENCE!\n-------------------§r\n\n    §oKnowing there are both humans and anthros in this world is comforting in a way. The last dimensional mishap we had, the only sentient creature were slugs... slugs everywhere. That was... interesting.\n\n    Tangents aside, the Labrats look like they\u0027ll give me access to the first thing I\u0027ll need if I want to fix this mess I\u0027ve gotten myself into : chemistry equipment."

It only makes it glow when you hold the key and you are close by.\n\n    This makes losing and retrieving items a bit more difficult. You can still make waypoints, sure, but if you are on a long journey, you might forget. Be careful what you bring with you on each hunting trip, Bandit.\n\n    To help, I\u0027ve gotten in contact with a... well, they call themselves a \u0027Retrieval\u0027 crew. For a price, they will go in and magically retrieve items from fallen Mercenaries that have been \u0027Insured\u0027.\n\n    If you die, and you have something with Item Insurance enchanted on it in your main inventory (not inside a bag, they cannot guarantee the magic will work), they will Retrieve it, and you will respawn with it.§r\n\n    §o\"Wait, immediately?

The first two are kind of obvious... the last one is usually just a couple of resources. May be useful in a pinch?\n\n    Be warned though!
