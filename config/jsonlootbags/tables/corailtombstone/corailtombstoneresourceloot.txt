<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>The Ferret Business 0.4.0</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size: 24px;"><strong>The Half-Baked Fixer Upper Update!</strong></span></p>
<p>-------</p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 14px;"><strong><b>BE SURE TO UPDATE THE LEDGER WITH THE FIRMWARE UPDATE QUEST!</b></strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 14px;"><strong><b>(Future updates can be done with a single button in the main Better Questing menu!)</b></strong></span></p>
<p><b>-------</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>The original goal with this update was quests, quests, quests. With FTB no longer approving updates themselves, the modpack has to comply with Twitch rules to receive updates!&nbsp;</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>So this update is only about half finished. So why is it being uploaded now?</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>I'm starting to get multiple reports that folks are having issues downloading the pack from Twitch. So I figured now was a good time as any to get this update out for folks.</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b>Many of the new questlines do NOT have text yet. The quest framework is done for them, and they are doable from start to finish, but there is no explanation on what or how to do things, or any lore&nbsp; yet. Those will be in the next update or two!</b></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This update adds over 200 new quests, almost 200 new blind bags, lots of bug fixes, and more!</p>
